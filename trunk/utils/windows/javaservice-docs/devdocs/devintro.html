<h2>JavaService - Developer Introduction</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
JavaService is a software utility for the Windows NT environment, allowing a
Java application to be installed and run in the background as a system service.
</p>
<p>
Once the application is installed using JavaService, it can be run automatically on system
startup and may be controlled using the standard Windows system administration tools.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Server-type applications run without a user interface, usually accepting network communications
from client programs to perform processing. Typical applications of this type include web servers, file transfer
servers, database management systems and J2EE application servers (for example: Apache, MySQL and JoNAS).
</p>
<p>
The Java programming language provides a cross-platform environment for the development
and execution of client and server programs. This does not provide any intrinsic support
for background process control as there is no standard way for this to be implemented.
</p>
<p>
Within a UNIX or Linux system, server applications may be run in the background as 'daemon' processes,
initiated by a startup script. This mechanism is not supported in Windows systems;
instead, 'system services' are defined to run programs in the background.
</p>
<p>
The JavaService software provides the link between the cross-platform Java environment and
the system service handling of Microsoft Windows. It achieves this without requiring any
changes to the underlying Java application code of the server application.
</p>
<p>
The JavaService software is bundled with a number of Java applications, and may be downloaded
and used with many utilities and programs that need this functionality in a Windows system
for continuous execution of Java server processes.
</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>
JavaService itself is Windows application software, that provides a number of functions.
Those of most interest to users of this software are listed below:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Service Installation</dt>
<dd>Allowing a Java application to be installed and configured as a system service</dd>

<dt>Service Execution</dt>
<dd>Runs the Java code in the background, under control of the Windows Service Handler</dd>

<dt>Service Removal</dt>
<dd>Perform cleanup and un-installation of a service previously installed by JavaService</dd>
</dl>

<p>
An application may be installed as a service for automatic or manual execution using the
JavaService 'install' command, and can be removed using the JavaService 'uninstall' command.
For details of the commands supported by JavaService, refer to the <a href="devcmds.html">command descriptions</a> document.
</p>
<p>
The installed service may be stopped and started using Windows 'net start'
and 'net stop' commands, or execution status may be changed from Windows Administration Tools.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
In order that a Java application can be executed as a Windows system service, the following
requirements must be met:
</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaService executable (which should be accompanied by the relevant license text file).</li>
<li>Java application classes available in a correct classpath directory or JAR file.</li>
<li>Details of the main program entry point class name to be used for the server process.</li>
<li>Java 2 run-time environment installed into the Windows system.</li>
<li>Windows user login with administrative rights.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>
The following limitations apply to the use of JavaService in running Java applications
as Windows system services:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Design of application to operate in server mode, with no console or GUI interaction.</li>
<li>Windows NT, 2000, XP or 2003 are supported - not Windows 95, 98 or Me.</li>
<li>64-bit Windows architecture is not supported - JavaService is not built for this platform.</li>
</ul>
