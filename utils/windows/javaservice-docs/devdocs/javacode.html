<h2>JavaService - Developing Java Applications</h2>

<p>
There are no specific requirements for development of a Java application that is to be
executed as a Windows system service. If the application can be run as a standard
Java program, and does not provide a direct user interface, it can be installed for
background execution by the JavaService utility.
</p>

<h3>Main Program Entry Point</h3>

<p>
The standard entry point for any Java program is a 'main' method with the following signature:
</p>
<p>
<code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
</p>
<p>
When the Java program is installed by JavaService, the default mode of execution will invoke
this same method when the service is started by Windows. If any startup parameters are
specified in the service configuration, they are passed in as values in the <em>args</em> String array.
</p>

<h3>Startup Method</h3>

<p>
An alternative to the standard 'main' method is for the application to provide an additional
method for use specifically when running the application as a service.
This function exposes the same signature as the 'main' method, but may have any name
chosen by the developer. It may also be in a different class if required.
</p>
<p>
The startup method (and class) is specified at service installation time and is invoked in the same
way as the default 'main' method, with any startup parameters provided in the <em>args</em> String array.
</p>


<h3>Shutdown Method</h3>

<p>
JavaService doea not require that a shutdown method is defined within the application.
If one is not present, or not specified, service shutdown is achieved by terminating the
Java run-time environment thread that executes within the JavaService program.
</p>

<p>
The design of most server-type applications generally uses some form of centralised status control
mechanism. At the time of process startup, one or more threads may be created, with synchronised access
to some form of notification flag that will indicate when the threads should terminate.
In this type of design, a shutdown method can be used to change the status of this flag to cause
clean process shutdown when notified by JavaService.
</p>

<p>
The shutdown function used by JavaService must expose the same signature as the 'main' method and
is specified when the service is installed, along with any parameters that it requires.
</p>
