<h3>Preceding Releases</h4>

<h4>Version 2.0.9 - 17th January 2006</h4>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<p>
<i>303995</i>
<strong>Include service description parameter</strong>
<br>
Service installation now supplies (optional) description text for display by Services snap-in.
<br>
This feature is only supported for use from Windows NT Version 5 or later (i.e. Windows 2000, Windows XP, etc).
It is ignored if used on older versions of the Microsoft Windows NT platform (V3.5 or V4).
</p>

<p>
<i>304293</i>
<strong>Provide a simple way to use System.exit() to shutdown</strong>
If service does not specify an explicit stop function, JavaService invokes the standard System.exit(1)
function to terminate the JVM.
<br>
This results in any registered Exit Handler function(s) being invoked, which can perform clean-up of
application software if implemented to detect this condition on process termination.
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
There are no specific bug fixes included within this release.
</p>

<h5>Known Problems</h5>

<p>
No further known problems with this release.
</p>

<h5>Compatibility</h5>

<p>

</p>






<h4>Version 2.0.8 - 6th January 2006</h4>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<p>
No new features included in this release - internal changes only.
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
<i>304292</i>
<strong>Incorrect error message if -Djava.class.path= not supplied</strong>
<br>
An incorrect error message may be reported if an install command does not explictly define the classpath.
This states that the mandatory <code>-start</code> parameter is not present, even when included in the command.
The error occurs only when the CLASSPATH environment variable is defined and used by the install operation.
<br>
The software now handles this condition correctly in command-line parsing.
<br>
It also outputs an informational message whenever the CLASSPATH value is used by default for service configuration.
</p>

<p>
<i>304575</i>
<strong>Invalid use of quote characters in sample batch files</strong>
<br>
Invalid assignments in the DOS command files caused double quote characters to be included in the
generate service install commands, which would then fail to execute correctly.
<br>
The batch files have been updated to remove erroneous instances of quote characters.
</p>

<h5>Known Problems</h5>

<p>
No further known problems with this release.
</p>

<h5>Compatibility</h5>

<p>
Backwards-compatible with V2.0 and V1.2 releases of JavaService.
</p>

</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
<i>304209</i>

</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
<i>303998</i>
<strong>Overlapped I/O operation in progress</strong>

Improvements have also been made to error detection and handling in this area of code.
</p>

<h5>Known Problems</h5>

<p>
No further known problems with this release.
<br>
If no new reports are received, the Version 2 codebase will be moved to 'stable release' status.
</p>

<h5>Compatibility</h5>

<p>
Backwards-compatible with V2.0 and V1.2 releases of JavaService.
</p>


<h4>Version 2.0.5 - 30th August 2005</h4>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<p>
No new features included in this release - internal changes only.
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
<strong>Error Message Output</strong>
<br>
A problem was detected (not reported) with output of error messages when failing to install a service.
This release fixes this problem so that the correct error message text is displayed on any failure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Overlapped I/O operation in progress</strong>
<br>
Some minor code changes have been incorporated towards finding and resolving the cause of this
intermittent problem.
</p>

<h5>Known Problems</h5>

<p>
There has been a single report of a '<i>Overlapped I/O operation in progress</i>' error message when attempting
to install the CruiseControl service. This does not appear in testing with the SampleService code and
is being investigated further. Some changes have been included in this release to work towards a fix.
</p>

<h5>Compatibility</h5>

<p>
Backwards-compatible with V2.0.4 and V1.2.12 (and earlier) releases of JavaService.
</p>


<h4>Version 2.0.4 - 21st August 2005</h4>

<p>
This version of JavaService is the first official release to be based on the new Version 2 code base.
<br>
Hence it should initially be viewed as 'release candidate' status and not used for production software
environment until suitable testing and verification has been performed.
</p>


<h5>New Features</h5>

<p>
This version incorporates refactored code and additional commands, whilst maintaining complete
backwards compatibility with V1.2 commands and configuration entries. The benefits of the new
code base are aimed to support easier enhancements with new functionality. There is also a reduction of
code duplication, which should in turn reduce the possibilities for errors and improve the
maintainability of the application software.
</p>
<p>
The following new commands are included in this release:-
</p>
<dl>
<dt>-queryconfig servicename</dt>
<dd>To view the configuration entries for the named Java service</dd>
<dt>-status servicename</dt>
<dd>To display the current execution status of the named Java service</dd>
<dt>-license</dt>
<dd>To output the LGPL licensing text from JavaService</dd>
<dt>-help command</dt>
<dd>Displaying further help details for the specified command</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The software has been tested using the SampleService code and has undergone debug testing to
verify internal operation. The interface at the Windows Service level has been improved, whilst
maintaining the same Registry and Java JNI interfaces as used by previous releases of JavaService.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, using the JavaServiceDebug executable will generated debug-type output to a log file
for fault investigation. At present, this filename is fixed internally as <code>C:\javaservice.log</code>
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
There are no specific bug fixes included within this release.

<h3>Previous Stable Release</h3>
<h4>Version 1.2.12 - 1st August 2005</h4>

<p>
This is the final planned release of the JavaService utility from the Version 1.x code base.
</p>
<p>
It can be viewed as a 'stable' release, with the code having been used in essentially the
same form for a number of years, with limited internal changes at each release level.
</p>
<p>
Refer to V1.x documentation for release notes and prior change history.
</p>

<h3>Version Numbering</h3>

<p>
Releases of the JavaService product code are given a three-part version number, which is
incorporated in the binary image of the program as well as being used in the source control system.
There is a fourth part to the version number, used for internal build release tracking only.
</p>
<p>
The meaning of each part of the version number is explained below, using V2.0.4.0 as an example:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Version Part</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First (2)</td><td>Major version number indicating codebase of the software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Second (0)</td><td>Minor version number for directly-compatible releases</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third (4)</td><td>Incremental version number for patch releases of software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fourth (0)</td><td>Build tracking number, may be used for custom builds</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Compatibility will be maintained between releases of software with the same major version numbers,
unless there is a particular problem identified and resolved in the later release. Software releases
with the same major and minor release numbers shall be compatible in all cases (accepting that
additional functionality may be included in the later release).
