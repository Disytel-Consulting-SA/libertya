<h3>Available Operations</h3>

<h4>Service Installation</h4>

<p>
The main command function needed from JavaService is the ability to install a Java application as a Windows system service.
</p>

<p>
From a Windows command prompt, or a suitably defined script file, enter the command:
<br>
<code>JavaService -install</code>
<br>
Followed by the relevant parameters as described below. Ensure that quotation marks are
used around an parameters that contain spaces to avoid run-time failures.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>service_name</i> (mandatory) - The name that you want to use 
	  for this service. This is what the service will show up as in the 
	  service control manager.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li><i>jvm_library</i> (mandatory) - The location of the jvm.dll file 
	  that you want to use as your Java Virtual Machine. For Sun's Java 
	  2 SDK, this is usually {JDK_HOME}\jre\bin\classic\jvm.dll or {JDK_HOME}\jre\bin\hotspot\jvm.dll.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li><i>jvm_option</i>* (optional) - To specify any  
	  parameters to pass to the JVM upon invocation. These may include 
	  things such as &quot;-Djava.class.path=&quot; to specify a classpath 
	  or &quot;-Xmx128m&quot; to specify a maximum heap size of 128MB. 
	  Any parameters that you need to use when invoking the java.exe command 
	  tool should be specified here. There is no fixed limit to the number of 
	  parameters specified.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-start <i>start_class</i> (mandatory) - The name of the class 
	  that you wish to use when starting the service. This must be the 
	  fully qualified class name.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-method <i>start_method</i> (optional) - The name of the static 
	  method of the <i>start_class</i> that you wish to call to start 
	  the service. The method must be <span class="textCode">static</span>, 
	  must return type <span class="textCode">void</span>, and must take 
	  a <span class="textCode">String[]</span> as its only parameter. 
	  If this parameter is not specified it defaults to <span class="textCode">main</span>.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-params <i>start_parameter</i>+ (optional) - Any parameters to 
	  pass to the <i>start_method</i> when starting the service. These 
	  will be passed in as the <span class="textCode">String[]</span> 
	  parameter.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-stop <i>stop_class</i> (optional) - The name of the class that 
	  you wish to use when stopping the service. This must be the fully 
	  qualified class name. If no <i>stop_class</i> is specified, the 
	  process containing the Virtual Machine is simply terminated when 
	  the service is stopped.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-method <i>stop_method</i> (optional, but only allowed if a <i>stop_class</i> 
	  was specified) - The name of the static method of the <i>stop_class</i> 
	  that you wish to call to stop the service. The method must be <span class="textCode">static</span>, 
	  must return type <span class="textCode">void</span>, and must take 
	  a <span class="textCode">String[]</span> as its only parameter. 
	  If this parameter is not specified it defaults to <span class="textCode">main</span>.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-params <i>start_parameter</i>+ (optional, but only allowed if 
	  a <i>stop_class</i> was specified) - Any parameters to pass to the 
	  <i>stop_method</i> when stopping the service. These will be passed 
	  in as the <span class="textCode">String[]</span> parameter.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-out <i>out_log_file</i> (optional) - A file into which System.out 
	  will be redirected. If this parameter is not specified, System.out 
	  will not be redirected.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-err<i> err_log_file</i> (optional) - A file into which System.err 
	  will be redirected. If this parameter is not specified, System.err 
	  will not be redirected.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-current<i> current_dir</i> (optional) - A directory to use as 
	  the current working directory for the service. If this parameter 
	  is specified, all relative paths in the service will be relative 
	  to relative to the specified directory.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-path<i> extra_path</i> (optional) - An addition to the path for 
	  the service. The specified path will be appended to the system path 
	  before the service is started. This can be used to specify where 
	  additional DLLs that native libraries are dependent upon can be 
	  found.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
	<li>-depends<i> other_services</i> (optional) - Another NT service (or multiple services,
	if specified as a comma-separated list) that
	must be running before this particular java service can start. Will cause
	the named service(s) to be started automatically if required when starting
	the java service. Will also stop the java service if a specified service is stopped
	(usually with user confirmation first being requested by Windows NT).<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>-auto <i>or</i> -manual - Optional parameter indicating whether service
	should be run automatically on system startup (default mode), or if it should
	be started on demand using a manual command (i.e. net start service).<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>-shutdown<i> seconds</i> (optional) - Specify the amount of time that
	may be taken during processing of your shutdown/stop method. The value here
	is used as a timeout, so if the method has not completed in this length of time,
	the JVM process will be terminated to allow the service to shutdown completely.<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>-user<i> user_name</i> (optional) - Specify the Windows domain username to be
	used when running the service (also requires that the password parameter is specified).<br>
	Local user accounts are specified as <i>.\user_name</i> whereas domain accounts may be
	specified as either <i>domain\user_name</i> or <i>user_name@domain</i> (the latter form has
	been required on some systems to avoid reports of 'I/O Operation in progress' errors).<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>-password<i> password</i> (optional) - Specify the Windows password associated with
	the domain username specified for use when running the service (required if the user parameter is specified).<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>-append <i>or</i> -overwrite - Optional parameter indicating whether output
	and error log files are to be appended to, or overwritten, on each service startup.
	If not specified, the default is to append to existing log files.<br>
	<br>
	</li>
	<li>-description service_desc - Optional parameter indicating descriptive text
	to be recorded against the service when installed. Use "quote characters" for
	text that includes spaces. Note that this function is only supported when used
	from Windows NT Version 5 or later (Windows 2000, Windows XP, etc).<br>
	<br>
	</li>
</ul>

<h5>Example Command</h5>
      <p >A simple example might look like the following:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="mainCode">JavaService.exe -install &quot;My Service&quot; c:\j2sdk\jre\bin\server\jvm.dll 
          -Djava.class.path=c:\app\classes.jar -start&nbsp;com.my.ExampleClass -err&nbsp;c:\app\stderr.txt</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p >This would create a service that, when started, would 
        create a JVM from the JDK in c:\j2sdk using a classpath set to be c:\app\classes.jar.
        It would then call the main method of the com.my.ExampleClass class with 
        a String array of length 0 (no parameters). Anything written to System.err 
        would be redirected into the file c:\app\stderr.txt.<br>
      </p>


<h5>Technical Tip</h5>
<p>
Especially when running more than one Java application as a service, you may find it useful to
copy and rename the program file before each use to indicate the application name concerned.
</p>
<p>
In this way, the Windows Task Manager will show the relevant program name in its list of processes,
where <code>AbcService.exe</code> and <code>XyzService.exe</code>
would be clearer than two entries for <code>JavaService.exe</code> if renaming is not used.
</p>


<h4>Starting a Service</h4>

<p>
Once a service has been installed with a given name, there are three ways in which service execution may be started.
</p>

<h5>Automatic Startup</h5>

<p>
If a service is specified with <em>automatic</em> startup, it will be executed when the Windows system is booted and started up.
Automatic startup mode is the default when installing services using JavaService. This can be overridden with the <code>-manual</code>
option on the install command. It may also be changed using the Windows administrative tools, to switch from <em>automatic</em> to
<em>manual</em> startup mode.
</p>

<h5>Net Start Command</h5>

<p>
The standard Windows command for starting system services is the 'net start' command.
This can be issued from a Windows prompt, specifying the service name as shown in the following example:
<br>
<code>net start myservice</code>
</p>

<h5>Service Management Tool</h5>

<p>
Windows provides a system management utility to provide control of system services from a graphical front-end.
This is available from the Start Menu or Control Panel <em>Administrative Tools</em> list, as the <em>Service</em> utility.
</p>
<p>
This utility lists all configured services, indicating their startup mode and current status.
Tasks and menu options are available to start or stop service execution, or to disable a service entirely.
</p>

<h4>Stopping a Service</h4>

<p>
There are two ways in which a currently executing service may be stopped.
</p>

<h5>Net Stop Command</h5>

<p>
The standard Windows command for stopping executiong of system services is the 'net stop' command.
This can be issued from a Windows prompt, specifying the service name as shown in the following example:
<br>
<code>net stop myservice</code>
</p>

<h5>Service Management Tool</h5>

<p>
The Windows <em>Services</em> utility is available from the Start Menu or Control Panel.
It displays the status of all configured services and provides tasks and menu options
to stop services that are currently running within the system.
</p>


<h4>Removing a Service</h4>

<p>
JavaService provides a command to enable configuration of a Java service to be correctly removed from the system.
</p>
<p>
From a Windows command prompt, or a suitably defined script file, enter the command:
<br>
<code>JavaService -uninstall <i>service_name</i></code>
<br>
Where:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>service_name</i> (mandatory) - The name of the service that is to be removed.<br>
	  <br>
	</li>
</ul>


<h4>Version Number Query</h4>

<p>
The version number of the JavaService software is available using either of two methods on the Windows platform.
</p>
<p>
One method is to enter the command
<code>JavaService -version</code>
<br>
when the program will display version and copyright information.
</p>

<p>
An alternative method is to locate and select the <em>JavaService.exe</em> file in Windows Explorer and select
the <em>Properties</em> option from the right-click menu, or press <em>Alt+Enter</em> as a shortcut.
<br>
The version number and copyright information for the program can then be viewed from the property tabs
displayed by Windows.
</p>


<h3>Registry Settings</h3>

<p >JavaService stores the configuration information for installed services in the Windows system registry,
under the location:
</p>
<p>
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ SYSTEM\ CurrentControlSet\ Services\ {SERVICE_NAME}\ Parameters</code>
</p>
<p>
The following keys are used and may be changed after service installation to modify the behaviour of the service.
</p>
<blockquote> 
        <p >Current Directory - The current working directory 
          for the service.</p>
        <p >JVM Library - The location of the jvm.dll library 
          to use to create the Java Virtual Machine.</p>
        <p >JVM Option Count - The number of option to pass 
          to the JVM when creating it.</p>
        <p >JVM Option Number <i>n</i> - An option to pass to 
          the JVM. <i>n</i> ranges from 0 to &quot;JVM Option Count&quot; - 1.</p>
        <p >Path - Extra path information that will be appended 
          to the system path before the service is started.</p>
        <p >Start Class - The class to use to start the service.</p>
        <p >Start Method - The static method to call on the 
          &quot;Start Class&quot; to start the service.</p>
        <p >Start Param Count - The number of parameters to 
          pass to the &quot;Start Method&quot; to start the service.</p>
        <p >Start Param Number n - A parameter to pass to the 
          &quot;Start Method&quot; to start the service. n ranges from 0 to &quot;Start 
          Param Count&quot; - 1.</p>
        <p >Stop Class - The class to use to stop the service. 
          If this key is absent, the process containing the JVM will simply be 
          terminated when the service is stopped.</p>
        <p >Stop Method - The static method to call on the &quot;Stop 
          Class&quot; to stop the service.</p>
        <p >Stop Param Count - The number of parameters to pass 
          to the &quot;Stop Method&quot; to stop the service.</p>
        <p >Stop Param Number n - A parameter to pass to the 
          &quot;Stop Method&quot; to stop the service. n ranges from 0 to &quot;Stop 
          Param Count&quot; - 1.</p>
        <p >System.err File - A file into which System.err will 
          be redirected. If this key is absent, System.err will not be redirected.</p>
        <p >System.out File - A file into which System.out will 
          be redirected. If this key is absent, System.out will not be redirected.</p>
        <p >Shutdown Timeout - The number of milliseconds to allow for
		the Java Stop method to complete, before timeout and JVM forced termination.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Event Log Messages</h3>

<p>
JavaService logs both informational events and errors 
into the Application portion of the Windows Event Log.
</p>
<p>
Informational messages record events when the service is started and one when it is stopped.
Error messages may be logged because of a configuration problem or other system error.
</p>
<p>
If you are having trouble getting JavaService to run your 
application, you should first check the Application portion of the Event 
Log to see if any errors were reported. Additionally you can check the 
redirected System.err file, as any Java exceptions will be written there 
by the Virtual Machine of the run-time environment.
</p>
<p>
Note that if the JavaService executable used at service installation is deleted from the system,
the content of the event log messages cannot be displayed by the Event Viewer. Instead, the
message id value will be shown with some Microsoft error text, plus any parameter values that
would normally be included in the formatted message text.
